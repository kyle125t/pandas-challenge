1.) Most players are male.
2.) Nearly 66% of players are between the ages of 15 and 24.
3.) The age range for purchase counts is very similar to that of the player age demographics.
4.) The youngest players were tied with the second oldest bucket for highest purchase price (kids stealing parents' credit cards?!)
5.) Every age bin had a higher purchase total per person than their average purchase price, indicating each player will almost always make more than one purchase.
6.) No individual player has more than 5 purchases.
7.) Most Profitable Items...won't return that value because we don't know the margins/what it cost to "make" that item. They can't possibly be 100% profit.
